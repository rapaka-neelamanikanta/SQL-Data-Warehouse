# 🚀 SQL Data Warehouse from Scratch  
### End-to-End Data Engineering Project  
**Medallion Architecture | Star Schema | Enterprise SQL Design**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases the **design and implementation of a real-world SQL Data Warehouse from scratch**, following **industry-standard data engineering best practices**.

The solution transforms **raw operational data** from multiple source systems into **analytics-ready datasets** using a **layered Medallion Architecture** and **dimensional modeling (Star Schema)**.

🔹 Designed for BI & reporting  
🔹 Built with scalability & maintainability in mind  
🔹 Focused on real enterprise use cases

## 🧠 Business Problem

Modern organizations collect data from multiple systems such as **CRM, ERP, and Sales platforms**, but face challenges like:

❌ Raw and inconsistent data  
❌ Poor data quality  
❌ No analytics-ready structure  
❌ Difficult and slow reporting  

---

## ✅ Solution Approach

A **centralized SQL Data Warehouse** was built to:

✔ Ingest raw source data  
✔ Clean and standardize records  
✔ Apply business rules  
✔ Deliver analytics-optimized fact & dimension tables  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

### Architecture Type
- **Data Warehouse**
- **Medallion Architecture**

### Layered Design
- **Bronze** → Raw data ingestion  
- **Silver** → Cleaned & standardized data  
- **Gold** → Business-ready analytics models  

This separation ensures:
- Clear data ownership  
- Easy debugging  
- Scalable ETL pipelines

## 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data Ingestion

### 🎯 Purpose
The Bronze layer stores **raw, unprocessed data exactly as received from source systems**.

### Key Characteristics
- No transformations applied
- Source-aligned schemas
- Acts as a system of record

### SQL & Engineering Skills Used
- DDL & DML
- CSV ingestion using `BULK INSERT`
- Stored Procedures for ingestion logic
- Schema-based layer isolation

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer — Data Cleansing & Transformation

### 🎯 Purpose
The Silver layer focuses on **data quality, consistency, and standardization**.

### Transformations Applied
✔ Duplicate removal  
✔ NULL value handling  
✔ String trimming & formatting  
✔ Standardization of codes and abbreviations  
✔ Normalization of attributes  
✔ Data enrichment  

### SQL Concepts & Functions Used
- `ROW_NUMBER()` for deduplication  
- `TRIM()` for string cleanup  
- `SUBSTRING()` for attribute extraction  
- `ISNULL()` for null handling  
- `LEAD()` for historical logic  
- Window Functions  
- Data validation rules  



### 🥇 Gold Layer — Business-Ready Analytics

### 🎯 Purpose
The **Gold Layer** represents the **final, analytics-optimized datasets** designed for direct consumption by:

- 📊 Power BI / Tableau dashboards  
- 📈 Business analytics & KPI reporting  
- 🧠 Decision-making systems  

This layer follows **dimensional modeling best practices** to ensure **performance, clarity, and scalability**.

---

## ⭐ Dimensional Modeling Approach

### Selected Model: **Star Schema**

**Why Star Schema?**
- ✅ Simple and intuitive design
- ✅ High query performance
- ✅ BI-tool friendly
- ✅ Industry standard for analytics

### Core Components
- **Fact Table** → Quantitative business metrics  
- **Dimension Tables** → Descriptive attributes

## 👁️ SQL Views (Analytics Layer)

To simplify analytics access, **SQL Views** were created for:

- Customer Dimension
- Product Dimension
- Sales Fact Table

> Views act as **virtual tables** that encapsulate business logic without duplicating data, ensuring consistency across reports.

---
